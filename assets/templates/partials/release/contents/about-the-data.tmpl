      <p>
        These National Statistics have been independently assessed by the UK
        Statistics Authority. They have been produced by following the standards
        set out in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/18/contents">Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007</a>
        and <a href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/">Code of
        Practice for Official Statistics</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that they:
        <ul>
          <li>meet identified user needs</li>
          <li>are well explained and easily accessible</li>
          <li>are produced based on appropriate data and methods</li>
          <li>are managed impartially and objectively in the public interest</li>
        </ul>
